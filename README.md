Mia - manual contact tracing & journaling
---

## What is Mia?

Mia is a chatbot that will prepare you in case of a COVID-19 infection: trace the people you were in contact with and notify them with appropriate advice.

You can find the Mia protototype here: [https://appmia.ch/#/](https://appmia.ch/#/)

### Principles

- **Trust**: The users decide how much data they would like to provide and what happens with it.
- **Impact**: Already the first user creates a direct impact on the spread of the virus for his surrounding.
- **Guidance**: The users are guided through the process by a conversational UI

### Feasibility

A running prototype that can be plugged and played into any process and easily scaled.

## How we built it

The prototype for Mia is a React web application that's built with Node.js.

Steps to run it locally:

1. ```git clone https://github.com/mia-app/mia-web.git && cd mia-web```
2. ```npm install``` *Will install all dependencies*
3. ```npm start``` *Will build the app and start a local development server*


## Whatâ€™s next for Mia

- Coordinate with Swiss FOPH & FMH distribution with test delivery, hospitals, chatbot integrations and diagnosis.
- Develop mobile app integrating contacts, geolocation (Pilgrim SDK), SwissID for governance and proximity tracking (NextStep SDK).
- Validating with user tests, getting feedback from experts
- Apply for funding (prototypefund.de, wemakeit.com, etc.).
- Enhance chatbot with AI (NLP Transformers, Image Processing)
